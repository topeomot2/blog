One of the main themes that quickly jump at you while using Flutter is that everything is a widget. The aim of this series is to help beginners understand this simple yet powerful concept and introduce them to basic widgets in Flutter.

To help us get more insight into Flutter, I decided to build a Twitter Mobile App UI but with the following constraint.

* Use only widgets that come out of the box in Flutter.
* Do not use external libraries.

For any point at which I deviate, you will be notified and given a reason. Below is the result and you can find the project at https://github.com/topeomot2/twitter-ui-app
