*One of the main themes that quickly jump at you while using Flutter is that everything is a widget. This series aims to help beginners understand this simple yet powerful concept and introduce them to basic widgets in Flutter.*

To help us in this journey, I built a Twitter Mobile Clone App using only the inbuilt widgets that come with Flutter. You can find the code at https://github.com/topeomot2/twitter-ui-app

Before going on to the different widgets we need to look at the concept of "State". This is not a term unique to Flutter but can also be found in other languages, the most well-known being React.

State generally means a set of properties that determine what "situation/condition" the application is in. One of the best analogy I have seen is the comparison of temperature as a State property that determines the "condition" of water. Increase the temperature to 100⁰C and above, water becomes steam (gaseous state), below 0 ⁰C, water becomes ice (solid state).
